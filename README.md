# HealthBuddy App

## Overview

**HealthBuddy** is a React Native application designed to provide users with a seamless health tracking experience. The app includes a beautiful splash screen and is built using modern technologies to ensure optimal performance and user experience.This project is still in progress.

## Features

- Splash screen with smooth animations
- Custom UI components for text and styling
- Fully responsive design using `react-native-responsive-fontsize`
- Uses `react-native-linear-gradient` for gradient effects
- Built with scalability in mind

## Screens

- **SplashScreen**: Displays an animated splash screen with a health-related logo and introduction text.
- **HealthBuddyScreen**: Placeholder for the main functionality screen of the app.

## Technologies Used

- **React Native**: A popular framework for building mobile apps.
- **react-navigation**: For navigation and routing between screens.
- **react-native-linear-gradient**: To create smooth gradients.
- **react-native-reanimated**: For animations in the app.
- **react-native-vector-icons**: For using custom icons in the app.
- **Custom Components**: Custom-built components like `CustomText` for handling consistent styling across the app.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/healthbuddy.git
   ```

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app — you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.

## Step 3: Modifying your App

Now that you have successfully run the app, let's modify it.

1. Open `App.tsx` in your text editor of choice and edit some lines.
2. For **Android**: Press the <kbd>R</kbd> key twice or select **"Reload"** from the **Developer Menu** (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (on Window and Linux) or <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (on macOS)) to see your changes!

   For **iOS**: Hit <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> in your iOS Simulator to reload the app and see your changes!

## Congratulations! :tada:

You've successfully run and modified your React Native App. :partying_face:
